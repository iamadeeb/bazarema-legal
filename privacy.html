        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: September 5, 2025</p>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Bazarema ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect information to provide and improve our services to you. The types of information we collect depend on how you use our App.</p>
        
        <h3>Information You Provide to Us:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your name and email address. You can sign in using your Google account (on Android and iOS) or your Apple account (on iOS). We receive a unique identifier and your email address from these services.</li>
            <li><strong>Listing Information:</strong> When you create a listing for an item, you provide us with details about the product. This includes the product's title, price, description, photos, and general address details (e.g., city or neighborhood) which will be visible to other users.</li>
            <li><strong>Communications:</strong> When you use our built-in messaging system to communicate with other users, we collect the content of those messages.</li>
            <li><strong>Favorites:</strong> We collect and store information about the listings you add to your favorite list.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information We Collect Automatically:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We automatically collect information about how you use the App, such as the pages you view, the listings you interact with, and your searches. This data helps us understand user behavior and improve our App.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect information about the device you use, including its unique device identifier, operating system, and mobile network information.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics and Crash Data:</strong> We use Google Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics to understand how our App is used and to identify and fix technical issues. These services collect anonymous data about your interactions and any crashes that may occur.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To **provide and operate** the Bazarema App and its core features, such as creating listings and facilitating communication between users.</li>
            <li>To **improve and personalize** your experience, for example, by showing you relevant listings based on your interests.</li>
            <li>To **analyze usage** and diagnose technical problems using services like Google Analytics and Crashlytics.</li>
            <li>To **show relevant advertisements** using Google AdMob, which may use information about your activity to personalize ads.</li>
            <li>To **maintain security** and prevent fraudulent activity or other misuse of our services.</li>
            <li>To **communicate with you** about your account, transactions, or important updates to the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>We may share your information in the following situations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>With Other Users:</strong> When you create a listing, the information you provide (title, price, description, photos, and address details) is publicly visible to other users. When you communicate with another user through our messaging system, they will see your messages.</li>
            <li><strong>With Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> We work with third-party companies that provide services on our behalf, such as analytics and advertising (Google AdMob, Google Analytics, Firebase Crashlytics). These partners have access to the data necessary to perform their services but are not permitted to use it for other purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to a valid legal request (e.g., a court order or subpoena).</li>
            <li><strong>In a Business Transfer:</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. Your Choices and Rights</h2>

            <li>You can access and update your account information at any time within the App.</li>
            <li>You can delete your account by contacting us. Note that some information may be retained for a limited time for legal and business purposes.</li>
            <li>You may be able to manage your ad preferences through your device settings or through the AdMob platform.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our App is not intended for users under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
